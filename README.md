To see the project in action visit: https://parsa.github.io/sciviz-pcv

## Problem Description

* Visualize multivariate elasicity data using the Parallel Coordinates technique
  * Download the input datasets "DataCij, DataMA, DataViscosity" from moodle
* Implement Parallel Coordinates to support various options:
  * Varying the number of dimensions (vertically laid out axes)
  * Dimension manipulation
  * Coloring different data points (items or cases)
  * Highlighting the selected data
* Explore and highlight clustering structures
* Provide the necessary user-interface

> ### Note
> If you would like to download this project and run it elsewhere please note that we dynamically load our data sets and most web browsers do not permit this operation unless it is on a web page. In other words, even though there is no server-side code in this project, you need a web server, however simple it might be, to test this code on most web browsers.
